# FYP - Financial Analysis and Prediction
Description
This repository hosts the implementation of several machine learning and time-series forecasting models to predict stock price movements. The models utilized include ARIMA, LSTM, and large language models, with data sourced from various financial datasets and news sources.

## Project Structure
- ARIMA/: Jupyter notebooks containing ARIMA model implementations.
- DataInputs/: Contains datasets and scripts for data preprocessing, including:
- News/: News data for different companies.
- Weekly-Closing-Prices/: Weekly closing prices for various stocks.
- LLM/: Notebook for using large language models.
- LSTM/: LSTM model implementation for time-series forecasting.
- outputs/: JSON files containing model predictions.
